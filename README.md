## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

*Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle weight (-0.0002) and spoiler angle (-0.01) provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

*Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered zero since the p-value is 0.00000000006712. Comparing this to the significance level, we can reject a null hypothesis.


*Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes, this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The multiple R-squared value is equal to 0.7119 or 71.19% which means that ~71% of the time the predictions will be accurate using this linear model.
